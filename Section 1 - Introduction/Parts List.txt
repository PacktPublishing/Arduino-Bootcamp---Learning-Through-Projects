Parts List
I have included the parts list in the resources section of this lecture.

This is a list of parts for projects that you will need for this course. I will do my best to keep this updated. If a link to an online seller is not working, notify me and I will try to update with an alternative. This can happen from time to time if a vendor runs out of stock or discontinues selling a particular part.

I would recommend getting an Arduino Starter Kit for the course. Most kits come bundled already with 90% to 95% of the parts that you will need for this course.

Since this is a hands-on, projects-based learning class, the best way to effectively learn is to actually do the projects. You will derive the most benefit if you approach the class in this manner.

Also, you can plan ahead which projects you want to do and get the parts only for those projects. I will also give a list of parts by project to assist you with prepping.

I have tried to keep this parts list as updated as possible. If a link does not work or a particular supplier is out of stock, send me a note about this and I will have the list corrected and try to find an alternative link to another online supplier.
